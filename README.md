# 💓 Heart Failure Prediction using Ensemble Learning Techniques

This project predicts the likelihood of heart failure using **ensemble machine learning techniques**, mainly through a **bagging strategy** that combines four models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, and XGBoost. This ensemble boosts accuracy and reliability in early diagnosis. Additionally, the system features a simple **chatbot interface** to interactively guide users through predictions and health-related queries.
